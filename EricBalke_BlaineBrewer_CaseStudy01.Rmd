# 3.	Report the number of NA's in each column.

# 4.	Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state. Plot a bar chart to compare.

# 5.	Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?

# 6.	Summary statistics for the ABV variable.

# 7.	Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? Draw a scatter plot.
